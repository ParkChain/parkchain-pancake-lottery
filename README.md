# Lottery - ParkChain

The lottery flow involves users participating in a decentralized lottery game for a chance to win a prize. 
Users can purchase lottery tickets by using their CAKE tokens to enter the lottery pool. The smart contract 
determines the winning ticket(s) randomly at a designated time. The prize is then automatically distributed 
to the lucky winner(s) directly into their wallet. The lottery feature offers users an opportunity to engage 
in a fun and potentially rewarding activity, adding an element of excitement and participation within the ecosystem.
